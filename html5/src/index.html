    <h4>Oware Rules</h4>
  </div><!-- /header -->
  <div role='main' class='ui-content'>
    <p><b>Oware</b> (in <em>Akan</em> language) - a traditional game from Ghana, Africa,
      is a <em>Mancala (Manquala)</em> game.</p>

      <h4>Mancala and Related Terminology</h4>
      <p>There is a wide ranged class of games called <em>Mancala (Manquala)</em> games.
        Often the term <em>Sowing Games</em> is used, too.</p>
      <p>The term <em>Mancala (also Manqala, Mankala)</em> is derived from the Arabic
        term <b>naqalah</b> with its meaning <b>to move</b> an object. These class of
        games are well known worldwide. Nonetheless rules, structure of fields
        on board and even number of players strongly varies from game to game
        depending on geographic location, language and culture. Such that
        eventually the same game plus rules set could be found under a
        different name, too. Still the origin seem to be quite clear for
        specific types at least.</p>
      <p>As a common aspect of these <em>Mancala</em> games the basic rules set
        on each player's turn is quite equal. A turn usually is performed by
        picking up the whole amount of <em>tokens</em> available on a chosen
        <em>container</em> on board first. Then this picked up set of mostly
        one single sort of game <em>tokens</em> is <em>distributed</em> following a
        <em>path</em> on board formed by such <em>containers</em> holding the <em>tokens</em>.</p>
       <p><em>Distribution</em> on a player's turn is called <em>sowing</em>. Thus
         these corresponding games are known as <em>Sowing Games</em>, too.</p>
       <p>The <em>containers</em> are often being named <em>fields</em>,
         <em>trou</em> (in <em>French</em>), <em>pits</em>, <em>holes</em>, <em>depressions</em>,
         <em>houses</em> or <em>bowls</em>. Some games come with different types
         of such containers. Mostly an additional non standard type
         of container is just used for holding tokens representing the
         current player's score. The score is reflected by the amount
         of tokens contained. These larger size bowls might be named
         <em>stores</em> or simply <em>Mancalas</em>. If such stores do not exist
         then tokens might simply be scored by removal from game play
         staying offboard for the rest of the game.</p>
       <p>Typically the <em>tokens</em> are represented by some game <em>pieces</em>
         like <em>seeds</em>, <em>beads</em>, <em>beans</em>, <em>nuts</em>, <em>stones</em>, <em>cowry shells</em>, or
         any sort of <em>counters</em>. Most Mancala games use undifferentiated <em>tokens</em>.</p>
       <p>In case of a <em>fixed sowing path</em> the bowls can be indentified or
         ordered by a simple <em>index numbering</em>. You might find terminology like
         a player's <em>side</em> or <em>ranks</em> or <em>rows</em> belonging to a player. In that case
         the player is allowed to start his turns by picking up all <em>tokens</em> from
         any non empty bowl being controlled by himself.</p>
       <p>The rules currently realized in this software project are commonly
         known as Oware, Awari, Wari, Aw&eacute;l&eacute;, Awal&eacute;, Aual&eacute;, Ay&ograve; depending
         on the geographic origin and language spoken (Ghana, Yoruba,
         Nigeria, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Cabo Verde, plus other regions).</p>

      <h3>Oware Rules</h3>
      <h4>Game Components</h4>
      <p>This Oware implementation uses a game board with 12 bowls in
        total - consisting of 2 rows having 6 bowls each. Initially
        each bowl holds 4 Bonduc seeds.</p>
      <figure class='diagram' style='min-width: 320px;'>
        <embed type="image/svg+xml"
          src='img/board_initial.svg' />
        <figcaption>Initial board position in Oware,
          while one player starts own turns with any chosen bowl 1 to 6,
          the other player starts own turns with a bowl 7 to 12.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>Objective of the game is to get a higher score than the opponent.
        This is done by harvesting more seeds than the opponent.
        The harvested seeds represent the score.</p>
      <h4>Turn Sequence</h4>
      <p>Players' turn alternates between the two players. A player's turn
        consists of the following phases</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Picking Up Seeds, then</li>
        <li>Sowing, followed by</li>
        <li>Harvesting.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Picking Up Seeds</h4>
      <p>The player starts own sowing turns from any non empty bowl of
        his choice in the row next to his own side. The whole content
        of the bowl is picked up leaving the bowl empty.</p>
      <h4>Sowing</h4>
      <p>Direction of game play is counter clockwise here in a circular
        sowing path. If reaching bowl 12 then continue on bowl 1 if
        necessary. The sowing starts adjacent towards the selected bowl
        in counter clockwise direction now. Although the seeds were
        picked up from an own bowl sowing is performed on all bowls.
        Such that the other player's row is included, too, interacting
        with the opponent's side of the board.</p>
      <p>Sowing is performed with exactly one seed per bowl following
        the consecutive bowls in counter clockwise direction.
        In case the sowing will reach the chosen starting bowl of
        the turn again then this bowl is skipped each time. Such that
        this bowl will remain empty in the end of this player's turn.</p>
      <h4>Harvesting</h4>
      <p>A player will score (also called <em>harvesting</em>) on sowing the last
        seed of his turn into an opponent's bowl holding 2 or 3 seeds
        including the last one sown. This is done by taking these seeds
        out of game play and scoring these. In case of previous direct
        adjacent bowls (in clockwise direction) being opponent's bowls, too,
        holding 2 or 3 seeds, these are taken away being scored as well.
        Reaching any other bowl without any seed, just one seed or four
        or more seeds will end the scoring even if any further
        opponent's bowls are containing 2 or 3 seeds not being
        directly adjacent.</p>
      <p>Taking and scoring all remaining seeds of the opponent's row
        completely at once is strictly forbidden and the player will
        lose immediately. Even if the player gets the majority of total
        seeds this way the player will lose immediately. Thus after
        scoring at least one seed must be left over on the opponent's row.</p>
      <p>Assumed the opponent ends his turn removing the last seed on his row
        by himself: The opponent's move is totally valid and game continues.
        In such a case then a player is not allowed to end his turn without a
        remaining seed for the opponent's turn if avoidable. Such that the
        player is forced to prefer any move that gives at least one seed
        being sown in an opponent's bowl then. In case this is not possible
        the game ends, the remaining seeds on board will not be scored and
        the player with the higher score wins.</p>
      <p>By mutual agreement players can end the game, too, at any time.
        In that case each player scores the remaining seeds on the own row.
        The player scoring higher wins.</p>
      <p>Such that the game could end as a draw on equal scores.</p>

      <h4>Typical Oware Game Material</h4>
      <p>If you are looking forward to getting a typical <b>Oware game</b> (<em>Ghana</em>)
        then the chance is quite high that the board shall be made of
        <b>Sese (Esese, Osese) wood</b> carved manually. Such handcrafted Oware sets
        are available in simple travel editions made of two similar half boards
        that can be folded to hold the game tokens securely then. Often these
        boards come along with decorative crafted and carved traditional themed
        patterns or motifs.</p>
      <figure class='diagram'>
        <img src='img/folded_oware_set.jpg' />
        <figcaption>Folded Oware set with traditional ancient African
          pattern.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Typical tokens could be <em>nickernuts</em>. These are tropical
        seeds of a shrub called <b>Bonduc</b> (Latin, botanical: <em>Caesalpinia bonduc</em>).
        Bonduc seeds are widely used for traditional African jewellery due to it's
        clay alike precious look and can be found as a medical ingredient as well.
        Such that there is a good chance of getting a spare set of Bonduc seeds
        if for some reason yours get incomplete.</p>
      <p>The more puristic travel edition could simply be formed by some pits on a
        sandy beach using any type of tokens you prefer of course. This solution
        is quite traditional, too.</p>
      <p>Surely some priceless unique or antique Oware sets can be found up to the
        size of a whole table. Watch out and find some of these gems using
        your preferred web search engine.</p>

      <h4>Oware and its Origin</h4>
      <p>With given rules as presented here today's name of the game is <em>Oware</em>.
        Oware is an <em>Akan</em> culture term. Commonly reported Oware is
        related to <em>Opoku Ware I.</em> (* 1700; &dagger; 1750), a former monarch
        of the <em>Ashanti</em>(<em>Asantehene</em>).</p>
      <p>In <em>Akan</em> language <em>ware</em> means <em>to be married</em>. Various
        sources exist telling legends about couples playing the game Oware
        endlessly - finally marrying to continue playing.</p>

      <h4>Mancala Priciples and Concepts</h4>
      <p>The ruleset used in this Oware implementation is in the
        public domain due to its age and unknown authorship. It is
        strongly assumed this Mancala game named Oware has its
        origin in Ghana, Africa. The term Oware is an
        Akan language term as spoken in Ghana and C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire
        (Ivory Coast), Western Africa.</p>
